It's been almost one year since the release of [React v16.8 (The One With Hooks)](https://reactjs.org/blog/2019/02/06/react-v16.8.0.html). Since then, we've seen many developers jump onto the hooks train and begin to rewrite their current applications to ditch class components and instead leverage hooks for state and side effect management. Hooks provide a more direct access to React's API and allow developers to handle writing reusable logic in the same sense they could write reusable components. Prior to the introduction of hooks, it wasn't immediately obvious the best way for components to share stateful logic.
