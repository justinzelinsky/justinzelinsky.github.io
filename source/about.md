My name is Justin Zelinsky. I'm a Baltimore native who enjoys traveling, reading (about history, economics, and political theory), programming (I'm a software engineer), and football. (COYS!)

My chief goal with this blog is to write about things I find important or interesting and I hope that you find something useful here as well.
