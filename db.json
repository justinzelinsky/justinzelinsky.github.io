It has become one of the expected technologies that any competent Web UI engineer is expected to be familar with, especially if they're using technologies like React. However, one of the biggest hurdles to using Webpack has been properly configuring it.\n\nIn this post, I am going to walk through my current webpack configuration for my personal [chatroom](https://github.com/justinzelinsky/chatroom) project. This project is what I work on in my spare time to hone my Web UI skills.\n\n## How to think about Webpack Configuration\n\nWhile Webpack technically works right out of the box and does not require any configuration file, almost all engineers will need to create one for any enterprise-level application. Your webpack configuration file is generally called `webpack.config.js` and is usually found in the root of your application.\n\nIt's important to note the filename -- `webpack.config.**js**`. It's a JavaScript file -- this means we're able to write JavaScript code when building our configuration object which Webpack uses. I believe we should heavily leverage this opportunity to make use of the fact we can script our configuration file and programatically make changes based on certain situations.\n\n## `webpack.config.js`\n\n### Imports\n\n```javascript\nconst { CleanWebpackPlugin } = require('clean-webpack-plugin');\nconst HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin');\nconst MiniCssExtractPlugin = require('mini-css-extract-plugin');\nconst OptimizeCSSAssetsPlugin = require('optimize-css-assets-webpack-plugin');\nconst path = require('path');\nconst TerserPlugin = require('terser-webpack-plugin');\nconst { BundleAnalyzerPlugin } = require('webpack-bundle-analyzer');\nconst { DefinePlugin } = require('webpack');\n```\n\nAt the top of your file, you'll likely be importing the various plugins or other libraries you'll be using when building your configuration. I recommend sorting your imports by their path, alphabetically. This is a general practice I recommend for two reasons:\n\n1. You're able to quickly scan the code for what you're looking for if you have an understanding of the relative location of the line of code based on the path name.\n\n2. You are less likely to run into merge conflicts with other team members if everyone is sorting things alphabetically -- lines of code tend to slip into their correct position by default when merging branches.\n\n### Program variables\n\n```javascript\nconst paths = {\n  source: path.join(__dirname, 'src/ui'),\n  dist: path.join(__dirname, 'dist')\n};\nconst apiAddress = 'http://localhost:8082';\nconst devMode = process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production';\n```\n\nOne of the first things I do in my file is define the variables that will be used throughout the file. In this case, I have three:\n\n- `paths`: A variable which contains all the paths needed for my configuration.In the above case, I have two paths -- `source`, located in `<rootDir>/src/ui` and `dist`, located in `<rootDir>/dist`. I can then access these paths via the `paths` object (e.g. `paths.source`)\n- `apiAddress`: The address of the backend server that the UI will interact with\n- `devMode`: A boolean which will tell whether or not webpack is running in production mode.\n\n### Webpack variables\n\nThe following sections all represent different properties that exist on a webpack configuration object. In my configuration file, I write each property as an indepdent variable, in alphabetical order, and at the end of the file, I export all of the variables as one JavaScript object. It will become more obvious as to why I chose this approach as we go through each property.\n\n#### entry\n\n```javascript\nconst entry = path.join(paths.source, 'index.jsx');\n```\n\nThis is the entrypoint of the webpack configuration. Here I am leveraging my `paths` variable and returning the location of the entrypoint of my application -- `<rootDir>/src/ui/index.jsx`.\n\n#### devServer\n\n```javascript\nconst devServer = {\n  contentBase: paths.dist,\n  compress: true,\n  historyApiFallback: true,\n  hot: true,\n  open: 'Google Chrome',\n  port: 9000,\n  proxy: {\n    '/api': apiAddress\n  }\n};\n```\n\n`devServer` represents the configuration object for `webpack-dev-server`. Explaining what each of these properties refers to is outside the scope of this article but you can read more at the [documentation](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server). Please note the references to `paths` and `apiAddress`.\n\n#### devtool\n\n```javascript\nconst devtool = devMode ? 'cheap-module-eval-source-map' : 'inline-source-map';\n```\n\nThis is the dev tool to use for the webpack configuration. It leverages the `devMode` property to determine which built in devtool to use when webpack bundles your code.\n\n#### mode\n\n```javascript\nconst mode = devMode ? 'development' : 'production';\n```\n\n`mode` is the property to tell webpack whether or not it's in production mode (and should use various production-related optimizations).\n\n#### rules\n\n```javascript\nconst rules = [\n  {\n    test: /.(jsx?)$/,\n    include: paths.source,\n    exclude: /node_modules/,\n    use: ['babel-loader', 'eslint-loader']\n  },\n  {\n    test: /.scss$/,\n    include: paths.source,\n    use: [\n      devMode ? 'style-loader' : MiniCssExtractPlugin.loader,\n      {\n        loader: 'css-loader',\n        options: {\n          importLoaders: 1,\n          sourceMap: !devMode,\n          modules: {\n            mode: 'local',\n            localIdentName: '[name]-[local]-[hash:base64:6]'\n          }\n        }\n      },\n      {\n        loader: 'sass-loader',\n        options: {\n          prependData: '@import \"src/ui/styles/vars\";'\n        }\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  {\n    test: /\\.css$/,\n    use: ['style-loader', 'css-loader']\n  }\n];\n```\n\nHere's where things get interesting -- this is our `rules` array. The `rules` array contains `rule` objects, each which represent how to treat different files that webpack comes across. So, for example, let's look at the first rule object defined:\n\n```javascript\n{\n  test: /.(jsx?)$/,\n  include: paths.source,\n  exclude: /node_modules/,\n  use: ['babel-loader', 'eslint-loader']\n}\n```\n\nThis rule is for files ending in either `.js` or `.jsx`. The `test` property is what determines which files this rule applies to. `include` and `exclude` refer to which directories that webpack should look for these files.\n\n`use` is an array of loaders which will process these files. In the above example, we're using two loaders: `babel-loader` and `eslint-loader`. It's important to note that the order of the rules matter and files actually start at the end of the array and move to the beginning. So in the above example, a file (e.g. `utils.js`) will first be sent through the `eslint-loader` (which will run eslint against it), and then send it to `babel-loader` (which will transform it via Babel). Another way to think about this is to imagine the loaders as functions that wrap one another. e.g. `babelLoader(esLintLoader(file));`\n\nPlease note the use of the `paths` variable in `include`.\n\n#### optimization\n\n```javascript\nconst optimization = {\n  minimize: true,\n  minimizer: [\n    new OptimizeCSSAssetsPlugin(),\n    new TerserPlugin({ extractComments: false, parallel: true })\n  ],\n  splitChunks: {\n    chunks: 'all'\n  }\n};\n```\n\n`optimization` is a configuration property which will be used when webpack is running in production mode. In the above configuration, we will be using two plugins (`OptimizeCSSAssetsPlugin` and `TerserPlugin`) and also splitting our code into chunks. Please refer to the webpack documentation for more details.\n\n#### output\n\n```javascript\nconst output = {\n  filename: 'app.js',\n  path: paths.dist\n};\n```\n\nThis property tells webpack where to output the results of the bundling process. Notice that we're using the `paths` property here.\n\n#### plugins\n\n```javascript\nconst plugins = [\n  new CleanWebpackPlugin(),\n  new HtmlWebpackPlugin({\n    template: path.join(paths.source, 'index.html'),\n    title: 'React/Redux Chatroom'\n  }),\n  new DefinePlugin({\n    API_ADDRESS: JSON.stringify(apiAddress)\n  })\n];\n\nif (!devMode) {\n  plugins.push(\n    new MiniCssExtractPlugin({\n      filename: '[name].[hash].css',\n      chunkFilename: '[id].[hash].css'\n    })\n  );\n}\n\nif (process.env.WEBPACK_ANALYZE) {\n  plugins.push(new BundleAnalyzerPlugin());\n}\n```\n\nHere's another interesting section. `plugins` refers to various webpack plugins which we want to use during our webpack build process. However, you'll notice that we conditionally add plugins. Thanks JavaScript!\n\nIn the above example, you see that we add three plugins by default:\n\n- `CleanWebpackPlugin` - this cleans the destination folder (defined in `output`) before Webpack outputs anything new when it builds.\n- `HtmlWebpackPlugin` - this plugin takes our `index.html` file and injects various properties into it. For example, we can have Webpack inject the title of the application. It will automatically inject any related css or javascript (or paths to the files) generated by webpack.\n- `DefinePlugin` - this plugin allows us to define variables which webpack will scan the code for and replace instances of them with the value defined in the configuration for the plugin. In the above example, we have a variable called `API_ADDRESS`. This variable is used in the chatrooms clientside websocket connection and in order to make the UI agnostic to what API it's talking to, we leverage Webpack to replace the variable with the appropriate value. This could be toggled based on different environments.\n\nYou will then notice that we conditionally add two more plugins. First, if we're not in development mode, we add the plugin `MiniCssExtractPlugin` -- this will be used to extract our css into a separate css file and this file will be injected into the `<head>` of our HTML file outputed. The second plugin we add is the `BundleAnalyzerPlugin` -- this is added if the environment variable `WEBPACK_ANALYZE` has been defined. In this codebase, I have a npm script which defines this variable and then runs webpack. This plugin is used to analyze how your webpack is built and what libraries are using more space than others.\n\nThanks to the fact that this configuration file is pure JavaScript, we can condtionally add plugins by just writing standard JavaScript code. Pretty neat!\n\n#### resolve\n\n```javascript\nconst resolve = {\n  extensions: ['.jsx', '.js'],\n  modules: ['node_modules', paths.source],\n  symlinks: false\n};\n```\n\n`resolve` is an object which helps Webpack determine how to deal with module resolution. `extensions` is an array of file extensions that webpack can use when looking for files. For example, imagine I have the following import in my JavaScript code:\n\n```javascript\nimport foo from './foo';\n```\n\nWebpack will search for `foo.jsx` and `foo.js` when trying to resolve this file path.\n\n`modules` is an array of paths to aid with module resolution. In the above case, we're telling webpack that when it attempts to resolve a module path, you can search the `node_modules` or `paths.source`. The latter is very useful because you no longer need to write relative paths for local imports. For example, if you have all of your components living inside of a folder `src/ui/components`, you can import one component from another like this:\n\n```javascript\nimport Button from 'components/Button';\n```\n\nand regardless of the location of the file with that import statement, Webpack will find the file for you.\n\n`symlinks` being false is an optimization which you can read about [here](https://webpack.js.org/guides/build-performance/#resolving)\n\n#### The final configuration object\n\n```javascript\nmodule.exports = {\n  entry,\n  devServer,\n  devtool,\n  mode,\n  module: {\n    rules\n  },\n  output,\n  optimization,\n  plugins,\n  resolve\n};\n```\n\nThat's it! That's our webpack configuration object. We have defined all of our variables above and we can simply export them together in an object.\n\n### Purpose\n\nI hope you see the value I am proposing by breaking up the configuration into separate variables. These variables, being independent from one another, allow you to programtically alter or change them based on what environment you're in. You do not have to worry about overusing inline conditional statements or anything like that. The final object being exported appears really clean and also allows you to quickly glance and see what properties you're actually configuring -- this is much easier to deal with than an entire object being exported which could be over one hundred lines of code.\n","source":"_posts/an-organized-approach-to-webpack.md","raw":"---\ntitle: An organized approach to Webpack configuration\ndate: 2019-11-22 18:05:20\ntags:\n  - webpack\n---\n\n[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org) is an excellent tool in the web developers utility belt.

I believe we should heavily leverage this opportunity to make use of the fact we can script our configuration file and programatically make changes based on certain situations.</p>\n<h2 id=\"webpack-config-js\"><a href=\"#webpack-config-js\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"webpack.config.js\"></a><code>webpack.config.js</code></h2><h3 id=\"Imports\"><a href=\"#Imports\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Imports\"></a>Imports</h3><figure class=\"highlight javascript\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br><span class=\"line\">3</span><br><span class=\"line\">4</span><br><span class=\"line\">5</span><br><span class=\"line\">6</span><br><span class=\"line\">7</span><br><span class=\"line\">8</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">const</span> &#123; CleanWebpackPlugin &#125; = <span class=\"built_in\">require</span>(<span class=\"string\">'clean-webpack-plugin'</span>);</span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">const</span> HtmlWebpackPlugin = <span class=\"built_in\">require</span>(<span class=\"string\">'html-webpack-plugin'</span>);</span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">const</span> MiniCssExtractPlugin = <span class=\"built_in\">require</span>(<span class=\"string\">'mini-css-extract-plugin'</span>);</span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">const</span> OptimizeCSSAssetsPlugin = <span class=\"built_in\">require</span>(<span class=\"string\">'optimize-css-assets-webpack-plugin'</span>);</span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">const</span> path = <span class=\"built_in\">require</span>(<span class=\"string\">'path'</span>);</span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">const</span> TerserPlugin = <span class=\"built_in\">require</span>(<span class=\"string\">'terser-webpack-plugin'</span>);</span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">const</span> &#123; BundleAnalyzerPlugin &#125; = <span class=\"built_in\">require</span>(<span class=\"string\">'webpack-bundle-analyzer'</span>);</span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">const</span> &#123; DefinePlugin &#125; = <span class=\"built_in\">require</span>(<span class=\"string\">'webpack'</span>);</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n\n<p>At the top of your file, you’ll likely be importing the various plugins or other libraries you’ll be using when building your configuration. I recommend sorting your imports by their path, alphabetically. This is a general practice I recommend for two reasons:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>You’re able to quickly scan the code for what you’re looking for if you have an understanding of the relative location of the line of code based on the path name.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>You are less likely to run into merge conflicts with other team members if everyone is sorting things alphabetically – lines of code tend to slip into their correct position by default when merging branches.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"Program-variables\"><a href=\"#Program-variables\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Program variables\"></a>Program variables</h3><figure class=\"highlight javascript\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br><span class=\"line\">3</span><br><span class=\"line\">4</span><br><span class=\"line\">5</span><br><span class=\"line\">6</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">const</span> paths = &#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\">  source: path.join(__dirname, <span class=\"string\">'src/ui'</span>),</span><br><span class=\"line\">  dist: path.join(__dirname, <span class=\"string\">'dist'</span>)</span><br><span class=\"line\">&#125;;</span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">const</span> apiAddress = <span class=\"string\">'http://localhost:8082'</span>;</span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">const</span> devMode = process.env.NODE_ENV !== <span class=\"string\">'production'</span>;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n\n<p>One of the first things I do in my file is define the variables that will be used throughout the file.

I can then access these paths via the <code>paths</code> object (e.g. <code>paths.source</code>)</li>\n<li><code>apiAddress</code>: The address of the backend server that the UI will interact with</li>\n<li><code>devMode</code>: A boolean which will tell whether or not webpack is running in production mode.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"Webpack-variables\"><a href=\"#Webpack-variables\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Webpack variables\"></a>Webpack variables</h3><p>The following sections all represent different properties that exist on a webpack configuration object.

The <code>rules</code> array contains <code>rule</code> objects, each which represent how to treat different files that webpack comes across. So, for example, let’s look at the first rule object defined:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight javascript\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br><span class=\"line\">3</span><br><span class=\"line\">4</span><br><span class=\"line\">5</span><br><span class=\"line\">6</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">&#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\">  test: <span class=\"regexp\">/.(jsx?)$/</span>,</span><br><span class=\"line\">  include: paths.source,</span><br><span class=\"line\">  exclude: <span class=\"regexp\">/node_modules/</span>,</span><br><span class=\"line\">  use: [<span class=\"string\">'babel-loader'</span>, <span class=\"string\">'eslint-loader'</span>]</span><br><span class=\"line\">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n\n<p>This rule is for files ending in either <code>.js</code> or <code>.jsx</code>. The <code>test</code> property is what determines which files this rule applies to. <code>include</code> and <code>exclude</code> refer to which directories that webpack should look for these files.</p>\n<p><code>use</code> is an array of loaders which will process these files. In the above example, we’re using two loaders: <code>babel-loader</code> and <code>eslint-loader</code>. It’s important to note that the order of the rules matter and files actually start at the end of the array and move to the beginning. So in the above example, a file (e.g. <code>utils.js</code>) will first be sent through the <code>eslint-loader</code> (which will run eslint against it), and then send it to <code>babel-loader</code> (which will transform it via Babel). Another way to think about this is to imagine the loaders as functions that wrap one another. e.g. <code>babelLoader(esLintLoader(file));</code></p>\n<p>Please note the use of the <code>paths</code> variable in <code>include</code>.</p>\n<h4 id=\"optimization\"><a href=\"#optimization\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"optimization\"></a>optimization</h4><figure class=\"highlight javascript\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br><span class=\"line\">3</span><br><span class=\"line\">4</span><br><span class=\"line\">5</span><br><span class=\"line\">6</span><br><span class=\"line\">7</span><br><span class=\"line\">8</span><br><span class=\"line\">9</span><br><span class=\"line\">10</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">const</span> optimization = &#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\">  minimize: <span class=\"literal\">true</span>,</span><br><span class=\"line\">  minimizer: [</span><br><span class=\"line\">    <span class=\"keyword\">new</span> OptimizeCSSAssetsPlugin(),</span><br><span class=\"line\">    <span class=\"keyword\">new</span> TerserPlugin(&#123; <span class=\"attr\">extractComments</span>: <span class=\"literal\">false</span>, <span class=\"attr\">parallel</span>: <span class=\"literal\">true</span> &#125;)</span><br><span class=\"line\">  ],</span><br><span class=\"line\">  splitChunks: &#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\">    chunks: <span class=\"string\">'all'</span></span><br><span class=\"line\">  &#125;</span><br><span class=\"line\">&#125;;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n\n<p><code>optimization</code> is a configuration property which will be used when webpack is running in production mode.

However, you’ll notice that we conditionally add plugins. Thanks JavaScript!</p>\n<p>In the above example, you see that we add three plugins by default:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>CleanWebpackPlugin</code> - this cleans the destination folder (defined in <code>output</code>) before Webpack outputs anything new when it builds.</li>\n<li><code>HtmlWebpackPlugin</code> - this plugin takes our <code>index.html</code> file and injects various properties into it. For example, we can have Webpack inject the title of the application. It will automatically inject any related css or javascript (or paths to the files) generated by webpack.</li>\n<li><code>DefinePlugin</code> - this plugin allows us to define variables which webpack will scan the code for and replace instances of them with the value defined in the configuration for the plugin. In the above example, we have a variable called <code>API_ADDRESS</code>. This variable is used in the chatrooms clientside websocket connection and in order to make the UI agnostic to what API it’s talking to, we leverage Webpack to replace the variable with the appropriate value. This could be toggled based on different environments.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You will then notice that we conditionally add two more plugins. First, if we’re not in development mode, we add the plugin <code>MiniCssExtractPlugin</code> – this will be used to extract our css into a separate css file and this file will be injected into the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of our HTML file outputed. The second plugin we add is the <code>BundleAnalyzerPlugin</code> – this is added if the environment variable <code>WEBPACK_ANALYZE</code> has been defined. In this codebase, I have a npm script which defines this variable and then runs webpack. This plugin is used to analyze how your webpack is built and what libraries are using more space than others.</p>\n<p>Thanks to the fact that this configuration file is pure JavaScript, we can condtionally add plugins by just writing standard JavaScript code. Pretty neat!</p>\n<h4 id=\"resolve\"><a href=\"#resolve\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"resolve\"></a>resolve</h4><figure class=\"highlight javascript\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br><span class=\"line\">3</span><br><span class=\"line\">4</span><br><span class=\"line\">5</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">const</span> resolve = &#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\">  extensions: [<span class=\"string\">'.jsx'</span>, <span class=\"string\">'.js'</span>],</span><br><span class=\"line\">  modules: [<span class=\"string\">'node_modules'</span>, paths.source],</span><br><span class=\"line\">  symlinks: <span class=\"literal\">false</span></span><br><span class=\"line\">&#125;;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n\n<p><code>resolve</code> is an object which helps Webpack determine how to deal with module resolution. <code>extensions</code> is an array of file extensions that webpack can use when looking for files. For example, imagine I have the following import in my JavaScript code:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight javascript\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">import</span> foo <span class=\"keyword\">from</span> <span class=\"string\">'./foo'</span>;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n\n<p>Webpack will search for <code>foo.jsx</code> and <code>foo.js</code> when trying to resolve this file path.</p>\n<p><code>modules</code> is an array of paths to aid with module resolution. In the above case, we’re telling webpack that when it attempts to resolve a module path, you can search the <code>node_modules</code> or <code>paths.source</code>. The latter is very useful because you no longer need to write relative paths for local imports. For example, if you have all of your components living inside of a folder <code>src/ui/components</code>, you can import one component from another like this:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight javascript\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">import</span> Button <span class=\"keyword\">from</span> <span class=\"string\">'components/Button'</span>;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n\n<p>and regardless of the location of the file with that import statement, Webpack will find the file for you.</p>\n<p><code>symlinks</code> being false is an optimization which you can read about <a href=\"https://webpack.js.org/guides/build-performance/#resolving\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a></p>\n<h4 id=\"The-final-configuration-object\"><a href=\"#The-final-configuration-object\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"The final configuration object\"></a>The final configuration object</h4><figure class=\"highlight javascript\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br><span class=\"line\">3</span><br><span class=\"line\">4</span><br><span class=\"line\">5</span><br><span class=\"line\">6</span><br><span class=\"line\">7</span><br><span class=\"line\">8</span><br><span class=\"line\">9</span><br><span class=\"line\">10</span><br><span class=\"line\">11</span><br><span class=\"line\">12</span><br><span class=\"line\">13</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"built_in\">module</span>.exports = &#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\">  entry,</span><br><span class=\"line\">  devServer,</span><br><span class=\"line\">  devtool,</span><br><span class=\"line\">  mode,</span><br><span class=\"line\">  <span class=\"built_in\">module</span>: &#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\">    rules</span><br><span class=\"line\">  &#125;,</span><br><span class=\"line\">  output,</span><br><span class=\"line\">  optimization,</span><br><span class=\"line\">  plugins,</span><br><span class=\"line\">  resolve</span><br><span class=\"line\">&#125;;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n\n<p>That’s it! That’s our webpack configuration object. We have defined all of our variables above and we can simply export them together in an object.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Purpose\"><a href=\"#Purpose\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Purpose\"></a>Purpose</h3><p>I hope you see the value I am proposing by breaking up the configuration into separate variables. These variables, being independent from one another, allow you to programtically alter or change them based on what environment you’re in. You do not have to worry about overusing inline conditional statements or anything like that. The final object being exported appears really clean and also allows you to quickly glance and see what properties you’re actually configuring – this is much easier to deal with than an entire object being exported which could be over one hundred lines of code.</p>\n","site":{"data":{}},"excerpt":"","more":"<p><a href=\"https://webpack.js.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Webpack</a> is an excellent tool in the web developers utility belt.

This project is what I work on in my spare time to hone my Web UI skills.</p>\n<h2 id=\"How-to-think-about-Webpack-Configuration\"><a href=\"#How-to-think-about-Webpack-Configuration\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"How to think about Webpack Configuration\"></a>How to think about Webpack Configuration</h2><p>While Webpack technically works right out of the box and does not require any configuration file, almost all engineers will need to create one for any enterprise-level application. Your webpack configuration file is generally called <code>webpack.config.js</code> and is usually found in the root of your application.</p>\n<p>It’s important to note the filename – <code>webpack.config.**js**</code>. It’s a JavaScript file – this means we’re able to write JavaScript code when building our configuration object which Webpack uses. I believe we should heavily leverage this opportunity to make use of the fact we can script our configuration file and programatically make changes based on certain situations.</p>\n<h2 id=\"webpack-config-js\"><a href=\"#webpack-config-js\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"webpack.config.js\"></a><code>webpack.config.js</code></h2><h3 id=\"Imports\"><a href=\"#Imports\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Imports\"></a>Imports</h3><figure class=\"highlight javascript\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br><span class=\"line\">3</span><br><span class=\"line\">4</span><br><span class=\"line\">5</span><br><span class=\"line\">6</span><br><span class=\"line\">7</span><br><span class=\"line\">8</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">const</span> &#123; CleanWebpackPlugin &#125; = <span class=\"built_in\">require</span>(<span class=\"string\">'clean-webpack-plugin'</span>);</span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">const</span> HtmlWebpackPlugin = <span class=\"built_in\">require</span>(<span class=\"string\">'html-webpack-plugin'</span>);</span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">const</span> MiniCssExtractPlugin = <span class=\"built_in\">require</span>(<span class=\"string\">'mini-css-extract-plugin'</span>);</span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">const</span> OptimizeCSSAssetsPlugin = <span class=\"built_in\">require</span>(<span class=\"string\">'optimize-css-assets-webpack-plugin'</span>);</span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">const</span> path = <span class=\"built_in\">require</span>(<span class=\"string\">'path'</span>);</span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">const</span> TerserPlugin = <span class=\"built_in\">require</span>(<span class=\"string\">'terser-webpack-plugin'</span>);</span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">const</span> &#123; BundleAnalyzerPlugin &#125; = <span class=\"built_in\">require</span>(<span class=\"string\">'webpack-bundle-analyzer'</span>);</span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">const</span> &#123; DefinePlugin &#125; = <span class=\"built_in\">require</span>(<span class=\"string\">'webpack'</span>);</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n\n<p>At the top of your file, you’ll likely be importing the various plugins or other libraries you’ll be using when building your configuration. I recommend sorting your imports by their path, alphabetically. This is a general practice I recommend for two reasons:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>You’re able to quickly scan the code for what you’re looking for if you have an understanding of the relative location of the line of code based on the path name.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>You are less likely to run into merge conflicts with other team members if everyone is sorting things alphabetically – lines of code tend to slip into their correct position by default when merging branches.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"Program-variables\"><a href=\"#Program-variables\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Program variables\"></a>Program variables</h3><figure class=\"highlight javascript\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br><span class=\"line\">3</span><br><span class=\"line\">4</span><br><span class=\"line\">5</span><br><span class=\"line\">6</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">const</span> paths = &#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\">  source: path.join(__dirname, <span class=\"string\">'src/ui'</span>),</span><br><span class=\"line\">  dist: path.join(__dirname, <span class=\"string\">'dist'</span>)</span><br><span class=\"line\">&#125;;</span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">const</span> apiAddress = <span class=\"string\">'http://localhost:8082'</span>;</span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">const</span> devMode = process.env.NODE_ENV !== <span class=\"string\">'production'</span>;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n\n<p>One of the first things I do in my file is define the variables that will be used throughout the file. In this case, I have three:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>paths</code>: A variable which contains all the paths needed for my configuration.In the above case, I have two paths – <code>source</code>, located in <code>&lt;rootDir&gt;/src/ui</code> and <code>dist</code>, located in <code>&lt;rootDir&gt;/dist</code>. I can then access these paths via the <code>paths</code> object (e.g. <code>paths.source</code>)</li>\n<li><code>apiAddress</code>: The address of the backend server that the UI will interact with</li>\n<li><code>devMode</code>: A boolean which will tell whether or not webpack is running in production mode.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"Webpack-variables\"><a href=\"#Webpack-variables\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Webpack variables\"></a>Webpack variables</h3><p>The following sections all represent different properties that exist on a webpack configuration object. In my configuration file, I write each property as an indepdent variable, in alphabetical order, and at the end of the file, I export all of the variables as one JavaScript object. It will become more obvious as to why I chose this approach as we go through each property.</p>\n<h4 id=\"entry\"><a href=\"#entry\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"entry\"></a>entry</h4><figure class=\"highlight javascript\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">const</span> entry = path.join(paths.source, <span class=\"string\">'index.jsx'</span>);</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n\n<p>This is the entrypoint of the webpack configuration.

The <code>rules</code> array contains <code>rule</code> objects, each which represent how to treat different files that webpack comes across. So, for example, let’s look at the first rule object defined:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight javascript\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br><span class=\"line\">3</span><br><span class=\"line\">4</span><br><span class=\"line\">5</span><br><span class=\"line\">6</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">&#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\">  test: <span class=\"regexp\">/.(jsx?)$/</span>,</span><br><span class=\"line\">  include: paths.source,</span><br><span class=\"line\">  exclude: <span class=\"regexp\">/node_modules/</span>,</span><br><span class=\"line\">  use: [<span class=\"string\">'babel-loader'</span>, <span class=\"string\">'eslint-loader'</span>]</span><br><span class=\"line\">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n\n<p>This rule is for files ending in either <code>.js</code> or <code>.jsx</code>. The <code>test</code> property is what determines which files this rule applies to. <code>include</code> and <code>exclude</code> refer to which directories that webpack should look for these files.</p>\n<p><code>use</code> is an array of loaders which will process these files. In the above example, we’re using two loaders: <code>babel-loader</code> and <code>eslint-loader</code>. It’s important to note that the order of the rules matter and files actually start at the end of the array and move to the beginning. So in the above example, a file (e.g. <code>utils.js</code>) will first be sent through the <code>eslint-loader</code> (which will run eslint against it), and then send it to <code>babel-loader</code> (which will transform it via Babel). Another way to think about this is to imagine the loaders as functions that wrap one another. e.g. <code>babelLoader(esLintLoader(file));</code></p>\n<p>Please note the use of the <code>paths</code> variable in <code>include</code>.</p>\n<h4 id=\"optimization\"><a href=\"#optimization\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"optimization\"></a>optimization</h4><figure class=\"highlight javascript\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br><span class=\"line\">3</span><br><span class=\"line\">4</span><br><span class=\"line\">5</span><br><span class=\"line\">6</span><br><span class=\"line\">7</span><br><span class=\"line\">8</span><br><span class=\"line\">9</span><br><span class=\"line\">10</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">const</span> optimization = &#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\">  minimize: <span class=\"literal\">true</span>,</span><br><span class=\"line\">  minimizer: [</span><br><span class=\"line\">    <span class=\"keyword\">new</span> OptimizeCSSAssetsPlugin(),</span><br><span class=\"line\">    <span class=\"keyword\">new</span> TerserPlugin(&#123; <span class=\"attr\">extractComments</span>: <span class=\"literal\">false</span>, <span class=\"attr\">parallel</span>: <span class=\"literal\">true</span> &#125;)</span><br><span class=\"line\">  ],</span><br><span class=\"line\">  splitChunks: &#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\">    chunks: <span class=\"string\">'all'</span></span><br><span class=\"line\">  &#125;</span><br><span class=\"line\">&#125;;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n\n<p><code>optimization</code> is a configuration property which will be used when webpack is running in production mode.

However, you’ll notice that we conditionally add plugins. Thanks JavaScript!</p>\n<p>In the above example, you see that we add three plugins by default:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>CleanWebpackPlugin</code> - this cleans the destination folder (defined in <code>output</code>) before Webpack outputs anything new when it builds.</li>\n<li><code>HtmlWebpackPlugin</code> - this plugin takes our <code>index.html</code> file and injects various properties into it. For example, we can have Webpack inject the title of the application. It will automatically inject any related css or javascript (or paths to the files) generated by webpack.</li>\n<li><code>DefinePlugin</code> - this plugin allows us to define variables which webpack will scan the code for and replace instances of them with the value defined in the configuration for the plugin. In the above example, we have a variable called <code>API_ADDRESS</code>. This variable is used in the chatrooms clientside websocket connection and in order to make the UI agnostic to what API it’s talking to, we leverage Webpack to replace the variable with the appropriate value. This could be toggled based on different environments.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You will then notice that we conditionally add two more plugins. First, if we’re not in development mode, we add the plugin <code>MiniCssExtractPlugin</code> – this will be used to extract our css into a separate css file and this file will be injected into the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of our HTML file outputed. The second plugin we add is the <code>BundleAnalyzerPlugin</code> – this is added if the environment variable <code>WEBPACK_ANALYZE</code> has been defined. In this codebase, I have a npm script which defines this variable and then runs webpack. This plugin is used to analyze how your webpack is built and what libraries are using more space than others.</p>\n<p>Thanks to the fact that this configuration file is pure JavaScript, we can condtionally add plugins by just writing standard JavaScript code. Pretty neat!</p>\n<h4 id=\"resolve\"><a href=\"#resolve\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"resolve\"></a>resolve</h4><figure class=\"highlight javascript\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br><span class=\"line\">3</span><br><span class=\"line\">4</span><br><span class=\"line\">5</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">const</span> resolve = &#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\">  extensions: [<span class=\"string\">'.jsx'</span>, <span class=\"string\">'.js'</span>],</span><br><span class=\"line\">  modules: [<span class=\"string\">'node_modules'</span>, paths.source],</span><br><span class=\"line\">  symlinks: <span class=\"literal\">false</span></span><br><span class=\"line\">&#125;;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n\n<p><code>resolve</code> is an object which helps Webpack determine how to deal with module resolution. <code>extensions</code> is an array of file extensions that webpack can use when looking for files. For example, imagine I have the following import in my JavaScript code:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight javascript\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">import</span> foo <span class=\"keyword\">from</span> <span class=\"string\">'./foo'</span>;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n\n<p>Webpack will search for <code>foo.jsx</code> and <code>foo.js</code> when trying to resolve this file path.</p>\n<p><code>modules</code> is an array of paths to aid with module resolution. In the above case, we’re telling webpack that when it attempts to resolve a module path, you can search the <code>node_modules</code> or <code>paths.source</code>. The latter is very useful because you no longer need to write relative paths for local imports. For example, if you have all of your components living inside of a folder <code>src/ui/components</code>, you can import one component from another like this:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight javascript\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">import</span> Button <span class=\"keyword\">from</span> <span class=\"string\">'components/Button'</span>;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n\n<p>and regardless of the location of the file with that import statement, Webpack will find the file for you.</p>\n<p><code>symlinks</code> being false is an optimization which you can read about <a href=\"https://webpack.js.org/guides/build-performance/#resolving\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a></p>\n<h4 id=\"The-final-configuration-object\"><a href=\"#The-final-configuration-object\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"The final configuration object\"></a>The final configuration object</h4><figure class=\"highlight javascript\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br><span class=\"line\">3</span><br><span class=\"line\">4</span><br><span class=\"line\">5</span><br><span class=\"line\">6</span><br><span class=\"line\">7</span><br><span class=\"line\">8</span><br><span class=\"line\">9</span><br><span class=\"line\">10</span><br><span class=\"line\">11</span><br><span class=\"line\">12</span><br><span class=\"line\">13</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"built_in\">module</span>.exports = &#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\">  entry,</span><br><span class=\"line\">  devServer,</span><br><span class=\"line\">  devtool,</span><br><span class=\"line\">  mode,</span><br><span class=\"line\">  <span class=\"built_in\">module</span>: &#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\">    rules</span><br><span class=\"line\">  &#125;,</span><br><span class=\"line\">  output,</span><br><span class=\"line\">  optimization,</span><br><span class=\"line\">  plugins,</span><br><span class=\"line\">  resolve</span><br><span class=\"line\">&#125;;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n\n<p>That’s it! That’s our webpack configuration object. We have defined all of our variables above and we can simply export them together in an object.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Purpose\"><a href=\"#Purpose\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Purpose\"></a>Purpose</h3><p>I hope you see the value I am proposing by breaking up the configuration into separate variables. These variables, being independent from one another, allow you to programtically alter or change them based on what environment you’re in. You do not have to worry about overusing inline conditional statements or anything like that. The final object being exported appears really clean and also allows you to quickly glance and see what properties you’re actually configuring – this is much easier to deal with than an entire object being exported which could be over one hundred lines of code.</p>\n"},{"title":"Redux Best Practices","date":"2019-11-22T15:24:56.000Z","_content":"\nRedux is a predictable state management library that can be used with many different UI frameworks. When using with React, you use it along side of the tool `react-redux` in order to connect your components to the store and to be able to dispatch actions and retrieve state. After working on multiple projects in my career using Redux + the time I’ve spent personally using Redux, here are some tips on how to structure your redux store and code:\n\n## Tips\n\n1. Make your store as flat as possible. When you have deeply nested objects, you’ll find that your reducers will contain a lot of copying and checking and it’ll be an absolute pain to maintain this code as your store grows.\n\n2. Leverage selectors as much as possible. Selectors allow you to compute state based on the application state. For example, imagine you have a list of accounts with a bunch of data associated with them. You can use a selector to build a new data structure for a component that may need that user list but in a different format. Selectors are memoized which means that all of your components which use a selector will only compute the value once and then it won’t update unless the store updates. The two main options are the `useSelector` hook that ships with `react-redux` and the library `reselect`.\n\n3. Use actions creators — action creators are simply functions which return action objects. I’d recommend keeping with the standard of having just two properties at the top level of the action `type` and `payload` and then put inside the `payload` object whatever you want. Technically a Redux action is an object with at least one property `type` and you can put whatever else you want in it but I think it’s better to follow the standard flux action pattern. (Note: There's also a property you can add called `error` which will mark an action as an error action. Set this property to `true` if necessary)\n\n4. Test your selectors and reducers — your selectors and reducers are where the vast bulk of your logic will exist and these should absolutely be tested.\n\n5. I personally recommend keeping all of your reducers and actions in one file, alphabetized. I find trying to navigate the redux store and seeing what is available is difficult when you have so many different files being imported and magically combined in the end.\n\n6. Your components should be as unaware of Redux as possible — from their perspective, they receive props and render them. They also receive actions via `mapDispatchToProps` and can execute them when needed. I’d avoid using `dispatch` as much as possible and instead create a shared function `mapDispatchToProps` which takes an `action` object (which contains all of your action creators) and then wraps it with `dispatch` — you can use the function `bindActionCreators` from `redux` to do this.\n\n7. Leverage redux middleware like `redux-logic` or `rxjs` or similar to handle business logic or side effects from actions being dispatched. For example, I’ve used `redux-logic` before and are able to you can define a certain type of action that, when dispatched, will invoke a function. You can even configure this logic to execute before or after the action has reached the reducers. I put most of my asynchronous work here + redirect logic because my components should literally just be in charge of rendering the view and at the most, dispatching actions.\n\n## Summary\n\nRedux seems complicated but the reality is that the complexity comes from misunderstanding how it works and attempting to overengineer it from the beginning. It’s a store (an object), an action (an object), and a reducer (a pure function). People make stores and reducers absurdly complicated which make it difficult to follow what’s going on during the lifecycle of the application and splitting everything up across many different files makes it hard to understand what the store actually contains. Put business logic inside of middleware. Reducers just update state. Components render the view. If you follow the rules of the game, you’ll have a much easier time using redux and won’t find yourself completely lost on how anything is being done.
